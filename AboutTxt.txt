I am Rodymir Randel S. De Leon, I am a 3rd yr student currently taking BSIT course at STI Global City. I enjoy using gadgets, and any other technology related stuff. My family introduced me to gadgets when i was a kid, I really love playing video games, It is one of my passion. When i reached college i started wondering how people do what we see in our screen right now, especially on websites, because of my curiousity, I am now aspiring to become a full stack web developer.
